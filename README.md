## Brainathon

`Brainathon Work` is complete workflow of EEG data analysis for the Brainathon 25 . 
The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Imports raw EEG data files from various cognitive tasks.
2. **Preprocessing**: Applies filtering, artifact removal, and normalization to clean the EEG signals.
3. **Denoising**: Uses advanced techniques (such as ICA or wavelet transforms) to further reduce noise and improve signal quality.
4. **Visualization**: Generates plots for time-series signals, power spectral density, and topographic brain maps to help users interpret the data.
5. **Feature Extraction**: Computes relevant features (e.g., band power, event-related potentials) for downstream analysis or machine learning.
6. **Saving Processed Data**: Exports cleaned and processed EEG data to CSV or other formats for further statistical analysis or modeling.
7. **Documentation and Comments**: Each step is well-documented with markdown cells explaining the purpose and methodology, making it easy for users to follow and modify the workflow.
