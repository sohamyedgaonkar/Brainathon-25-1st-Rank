## Brainathon.ipynb Details

`Brainathon.ipynb` is a Jupyter Notebook that guides users through the complete workflow of EEG data analysis for the Brainathon project. The notebook covers the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Imports raw EEG data files from various cognitive tasks.
2. **Preprocessing**: Applies filtering, artifact removal, and normalization to clean the EEG signals.
3. **Denoising**: Uses advanced techniques (such as ICA or wavelet transforms) to further reduce noise and improve signal quality.
4. **Visualization**: Generates plots for time-series signals, power spectral density, and topographic brain maps to help users interpret the data.
5. **Feature Extraction**: Computes relevant features (e.g., band power, event-related potentials) for downstream analysis or machine learning.
6. **Saving Processed Data**: Exports cleaned and processed EEG data to CSV or other formats for further statistical analysis or modeling.
7. **Documentation and Comments**: Each step is well-documented with markdown cells explaining the purpose and methodology, making it easy for users to follow and modify the workflow.

This notebook is designed for both beginners and advanced users interested in EEG data analysis, providing a reproducible and interactive environment for exploring
